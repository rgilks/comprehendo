# Application Improvements

## Recent Improvements (Latest Release)

### ✅ Language State Synchronization Fix

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Impact**: High - Fixed critical UX issue with language switching

**Problem Identified**:

- Language selector sometimes showed previous language while page content was in new language
- Occured when navigating directly to URLs like `/he` or `/fr`
- Created confusing mismatch between UI selector and actual page language
- Root cause: No synchronization between URL parameter and persisted store state

**Solution Implemented**:

- Modified `app/hooks/useLanguage.ts` to sync store with URL language
- Added `useEffect` to update store when URL language differs from store language
- Used URL language as source of truth for language display
- Added comprehensive e2e test for URL synchronization

**Benefits**:

- Language selector always reflects actual page language
- Seamless direct URL navigation across all supported languages
- Improved user experience with consistent language state
- Enhanced reliability for language switching functionality

**Testing Results**:

- All 35 e2e tests passing (including new synchronization test)
- Verified across multiple languages: English, French, German, Hebrew, Spanish
- Direct URL navigation works perfectly
- Language switching functionality remains intact
