# Application Improvements

## Recent Improvements (Latest Release)

### ✅ UI Logic Extraction & Testability Enhancement

**Date**: December 2024  
**Impact**: High - Improved code maintainability and testability

**Changes Made**:

- Extracted business logic from UI components into utility files
- Created `app/lib/utils/translation.ts` - Translation logic from TranslatableWord component
- Created `app/lib/utils/quiz.ts` - Quiz state management logic from Generator component
- Created `app/lib/utils/ui.ts` - UI interaction logic from ReadingPassage component
- Refactored components to use extracted utilities for better separation of concerns

**Benefits**:

- Better testability - business logic can be unit tested independently
- Improved maintainability - logic is centralized and reusable
- Cleaner components - UI components focus on presentation
- Type safety - all utilities are properly typed

### ✅ Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage

**Date**: December 2024  
**Impact**: High - Better code quality and reliability

- Tests placed in same folders as code they test (following project conventions)
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error scenarios
- Integrated unit tests into CI/CD pipeline

**Test Coverage**:

- `translation.test.ts` - 11 tests covering translation logic
- `quiz.test.ts` - 19 tests covering quiz state management
- `ui.test.ts` - 8 tests covering UI interactions
